# Roundels-and-Fin-Flashes
Roundels and fin flashes are identifiers painted on to military aircraft to identify the nation and or branch of service to which the aircraft belongs.
These images are in png format at 256 x 160 px.  They are intended to be used as flags in Kerbal Space Program.

##Install
Copy the contents of GameData into your GameData folder.

#Usage
Some parts have a flag decal added automatically, but mods can also be used to add the flag decal anywhere on your craft.
One such mod is [Flag Decals](https://mods.curse.com/ksp-mods/kerbal/222813-flag-decals-v2-3).  This mod works fine for me in KSP 1.1.3.
